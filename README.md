# LINCC Frameworks Rubin commissioning 

Notebooks and scripts written by or used by LINCC Frameworks during 
commissiong on Rubin ComCam data.

This is predominantly in service of providing HATS catalogs for Rubin data,
and showcasing science workflows using LSDB on those catalogs.

* To see some science workflows, check out the [demo notebooks directory](./demo_notebooks/)
* To see how we generate the HATS catalogs from Butler tables, see the code in [dash directory](./dash), and some discussion in the [dash docs directory](./dash_doc/).
