Peter, Michael, Aritra

As part of making hyrax work on the USDF RSP, Michael was able to get one calexp patch image from the butler.
Next steps are to make cutouts from this calexp on arbitrary ra/dec boxes ignoring cases where the ra/dec box intersects the edge of the patch.

Aritra and Peter downloaded Euclid VIS and NSIP data that overlaps with COMCAM. Data stored both on epyc and usdf.
